    Create db called "yoti". Simply type "use yoti" in the Mongo cli
    Requests are saved to roombaSimulateRequest collection
    Responses are saved to roombaSimulateResponse collection

The application exposes 1 endpoint for the solution. Run the following curl to access it:
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"roomSize":[5, 5],"coords":[1, 2],"patches":[[1, 0],[2, 2],[2, 3]],"instructions":"NNESEESWNWW"}' localhost:8080/roomba/simulate

The input data in the curl can be substituted out for different test cases.
